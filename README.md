# Quantum-Dots-Solar-Window-Dashboard
Quantum Dot Solar Windows convert sunlight into electricity using transparent panels. The ESP32 microcontroller reads light intensity from an LDR sensor and controls a relay to automate lighting based on brightness. An LCD display shows the systemâ€™s status, making it a smart, eco-friendly, and energy-efficient solution.
