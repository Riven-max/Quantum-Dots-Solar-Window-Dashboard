# Quantum-Dots-Solar-Window-Dashboard
Quantum Dot Solar Windows convert sunlight into electricity using transparent panels. The ESP32 microcontroller reads light intensity from an LDR sensor and controls a relay to automate lighting based on brightness. An LCD display shows the system’s status, making it a smart, eco-friendly, and energy-efficient solution.
Quantum Dot Solar Windows (IoT-Based Energy Monitoring System) is a smart, eco-friendly innovation that combines renewable energy generation with real-time automation. The system uses quantum dot solar panels, which are transparent energy-harvesting materials capable of converting sunlight into electrical energy while still allowing natural light to pass through. These advanced panels can be integrated directly into glass windows, transforming them into power-generating surfaces that maintain the beauty and brightness of architectural spaces.
The brain of the system is the ESP32 microcontroller, which manages data processing, communication, and control operations. It receives input from an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor that continuously monitors sunlight intensity. Based on the LDR readings, the ESP32 decides when to activate or deactivate electrical devices using a relay module. For example, when sunlight intensity decreases below a set threshold (such as during evening hours or cloudy conditions), the relay automatically turns on a connected bulb or appliance. This automation ensures optimal use of energy and prevents unnecessary power wastage.
An LCD display connected to the ESP32 shows the current system status—such as light intensity levels, relay state (ON/OFF), and overall operation updates—providing a quick and simple way for users to understand the system’s functioning. Additionally, through IoT integration, the ESP32 can send real-time data to a web-based dashboard, allowing users to monitor and control the setup remotely via their phone or computer.
The Quantum Dot Solar Window system thus offers a seamless blend of renewable energy and smart technology. It not only promotes sustainability but also provides comfort, automation, and energy efficiency. Designed for homes, offices, and schools, it empowers users to harness solar power directly from their windows while intelligently managing electrical loads. This project represents a step forward toward smart, energy-efficient architecture—a perfect fusion of innovation and environmental consciousness.
